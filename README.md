Problem Description:
Matrix:

i. Take an integer number n as input. Then take a n*n matrix as input. Suppose the given matrix is
A.
ii. Write a program to interchange diagonals of the matrix A. After interchanging the diagonals
suppose the new matrix is B.
iii. Then write a program in the same main function to get transpose of the matrix B. Suppose the
