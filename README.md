Problem Description:
Find out the smallest Sum from a Array:

Write a C program to find the sum of contiguous sub array within an array which has the smallest
sum. Also print where in the array the smallest sum occurred.
For example, given the array [4, -1, 2, -3, 1, -2, 7, -5, 4], the contiguous sub-array [1, -3, -2] has the
smallest sum of -4 and it occurred in [0:6].
To understand contiguous sub array, given the array [1, 2, 3] the contiguous sub arrays are [1], [2],
[3], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3], but [1, 3] is not a contiguous sub array.


Problem Description:
Matrix:

i. Take an integer number n as input. Then take a n*n matrix as input. Suppose the given matrix is
A.
ii. Write a program to interchange diagonals of the matrix A. After interchanging the diagonals
suppose the new matrix is B.
iii. Then write a program in the same main function to get transpose of the matrix B. Suppose the
transpose matrix is C.
iv. Now do the following operation:
3A + 2B â€“ C
